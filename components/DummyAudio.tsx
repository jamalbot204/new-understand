/**
 * DummyAudio Component
 *
 * This component renders a hidden, looping <audio> element with a silent audio source.
 * Its purpose is to act as a "proxy" for the browser's Media Session API and hardware media keys.
 *
 * Why is this needed?
 * Browsers typically link hardware media keys (like play/pause on headphones) and the Media Session API
 * to the playback state of a standard HTML <audio> or <video> element. Our application uses the
 * Web Audio API for more advanced audio control, which is not directly tied to these browser features.
 *
 * By synchronizing the play/pause state of this silent, hidden <audio> element with our actual
 * Web Audio API playback, we can ensure that the browser correctly recognizes our app as a media player.
 * This allows users to control playback with their hardware media keys, improving the user experience.
